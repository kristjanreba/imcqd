# Datasets
There are 3 train datasets and 5 test datasets in dataset folder
Train datasets: rand, product, docking
Test datasets: rand, dense, product, docking, protein, dimacs

Steps to get the final results:
1. Generate graphs (random, dense, product, docking)
2. Extract features from each graph and create a separate feature dataset
3. Create train datasets for each type of graph using MCQD algorithm
4. Create test datasets for each type of graph by running MCQD for default value
5. Train all the models the train datasets
6. Make predictions for all the models for each of the test datasets
7. Run MCQD algorithm again for each prediction on test dataset
8. Evaluation: compare the time of predicted values to default value of MCQD algorithm


Todo:
- make make step 1 and 2 into a single function
- make step 3 and 4 into a single function
- make step 5 and 6 into a single function
- make create a script that will handle the whole process from step 3 to step 8 with a single call


Ideas for improvements:
- use bayesian optimization for sampling best Tlimit parameter for train set
- when creating train datasets, use default Tlimit value if time difference 
is small from best to default value
